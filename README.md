   ```
   n8n-skills/
   ├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file
   └── resources/            # Detailed node documentation
       ├── input/            # Input category nodes
       ├── output/           # Output category nodes

       ├── trigger/          # Trigger category nodes
       ├── organization/     # Organization category nodes
       ├── misc/             # Miscellaneous nodes
       ├── community/        # Community package nodes
       └── templates/        # Workflow templates
   ```

### Installation Methods

Choose the n8n Skills installation method according to the Claude platform you are using:

#### Claude Code (CLI Tool)

Suitable for developers using Claude Code in the terminal, loading n8n Skills through local skills directory.

1. Create a `.claude/skills/` directory in your project root:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/skills/n8n-skills
   ```

2. Copy the extracted `SKILL.md` and `resources/` directory to that directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r n8n-skills/* .claude/skills/n8n-skills/
   ```

3. The directory structure should look like this:
   ```
   your-project/
   └── .claude/
       └── skills/
           └── n8n-skills/
               ├── SKILL.md
               └── resources/
   ```

4. Verify installation: Ask Claude Code "List available n8n nodes". If the Skill is correctly invoked, the installation is successful.

#### Claude.ai Web (Web Version)

Suitable for general users in browsers.

1. Log in to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Go to the "Settings" page and find the "Capabilities" section
3. Click "Upload skill"
4. Select the downloaded `n8n-skills-{version}.zip` file to upload
5. After upload completes, you will see "n8n-skills" below. If not enabled, click to enable it.
6. Return to the conversation window and ask questions about n8n. Successfully using n8n-skills indicates successful installation.

#### Claude Desktop (Desktop Application)

Suitable for users of the Claude Desktop application.

1. Open the "Claude" desktop application
2. Go to the "Settings" page and find the "Capabilities" section
3. Find the "Skills" section and click "Upload skill"
4. Select the downloaded `n8n-skills-{version}.zip` file to upload
5. After upload completes, you will see "n8n-skills" below. If not enabled, click to enable it.
6. Return to the conversation window and ask questions about n8n. Successfully using n8n-skills indicates successful installation.

### Basic Usage Examples

After installation, you can use it like this:

Query specific node information:
```
"What are the main features of the HTTP Request node?"
"How to send email using the Gmail node?"
"What programming languages does the Code node support?"
```

Explore workflow patterns:
```
"How to create a scheduled workflow?"
"What are the common node combinations for data transformation?"
"How to handle API errors and retries?"
```

Search for specific functionality:
```
"Which nodes can connect to Google Sheets?"
"What AI-related nodes are available?"
"What trigger nodes are available?"
```

### Real-world Use Cases

Here are real-world scenarios using n8n Skills:

Case 1: AI-Assisted Workflow Design

Scenario: You want to create a workflow that "automatically sends daily operational reports."

Before n8n Skills: You need to manually search n8n documentation, research each node's functionality, and repeatedly trial-and-error to find the correct node combination.

After n8n Skills: Simply ask the AI assistant "How to create a scheduled email report workflow?", and the AI will recommend based on n8n Skills knowledge:
1. Schedule Trigger (for scheduling)
2. HTTP Request or Google Sheets (for data retrieval)
3. Code or Item Lists (for data processing)
4. Gmail or Send Email (for sending emails)

Time Saved: From hours of research reduced to minutes of design.

Case 2: Exploring the Best Node Combinations

Scenario: You want to integrate Slack notifications into your existing workflow but aren't sure which nodes are available.

With n8n Skills: Ask "Which nodes can send Slack messages?", and the AI will tell you:
- Slack node (official integration, most comprehensive features)
- HTTP Request (uses Slack API, highest flexibility)
- Webhook (receives Slack events)

Along with explaining the pros and cons of each node, suitable scenarios, and configuration methods.

Benefit: Quickly find the most suitable solution for your needs, avoiding detours.

Case 3: Learning Workflow Best Practices

Scenario: Beginners want to learn how to handle API errors and retry mechanisms.

With n8n Skills: Ask "How to handle HTTP Request errors and retries?", and the AI will reference 20 curated templates and 542 nodes of knowledge to share:
- How to use Error Trigger node
- Built-in retry settings for HTTP Request
- Error handling pattern using If node with Stop and Error
- Real-world workflow examples

Accelerated Learning: From zero foundation to mastering best practices, systematically improving skills.

### FAQ

Skill won't load?

- Confirm the `SKILL.md` file is in the correct location
- Check if the file name is correct (case-sensitive)
- Verify the `resources/` directory structure is complete
- Restart the Claude application or refresh the webpage

File structure errors

- Ensure `SKILL.md` and `resources/` are in the same directory level
- Do not modify the file structure inside the `resources/` directory
